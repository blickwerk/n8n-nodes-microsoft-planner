- **Start Date Time**: When work on the task should begin
- **Percent Complete**: Task completion percentage (0-100)

### Getting Tasks

**Get a single task:**
- Enter the **Task ID** manually (no dropdown available for single task lookups)

**Get many tasks:**
- Choose filter type: **Plan** or **Bucket**
- Enter the **Plan ID**
- If filtering by Bucket: Select bucket from dropdown or enter Bucket ID manually
- Set a limit or return all tasks

### Updating a Task

To update a task:
1. Enter the **Task ID** manually
2. Update any of these fields:
- Title
- Description
- Priority (via dropdown)
- Assigned users (via email list)
- Due Date Time
- Start Date Time
- Percent Complete
- Move to different bucket

### How to Find Plan IDs

You can find your Plan ID in several ways:

1. **From Planner URL**: Open Microsoft Planner in browser, the URL contains the Plan ID:
   ```
   https://tasks.office.com/.../ planId=YOUR_PLAN_ID_HERE /...
   ```

2. **Via Microsoft Graph Explorer**:
   - Go to https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer
   - Sign in
   - Run: `GET /me/planner/plans`
   - Copy the `id` field from the plan you want

### Resource Locator (From List / By ID)

When creating tasks or filtering by bucket:
- **From List**: Select from dropdown (automatically loads based on Plan ID)
- **By ID**: Manually enter the ID if you already know it

For Get/Update/Delete operations, you need to manually enter the Task ID.
